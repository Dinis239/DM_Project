+ Employees that did the absences in this cluster have a lot (the highest amount by far) of pets, on average 4.
+ Highest transportation expense, but reasonable commute cost per Km, indicating these are simply long commutes.
+ A low rate of higher education, just 17%. Although this rate is actually third highest across clusters, but a long margin away from the top two, over 60%.
+ The yearly distribution of absences in this cluster has a clear summer peak, 51% of absences occur in the summer.
+ This cluster has a slightly higher than average rate of near weekend absences at 48%, values tend to be around 30/35%.
+ The distribution of absence justifications for this cluster is relatively normal, within the general expectation.
+ On average, absences in this cluster amount to almost a full working day (nearly 6 hours). 

For the “A lot of pets” cluster, employees tend to experience long commutes, significant personal responsibilities,
lower education levels, high transportation costs, and noticeable summer absences. Supporting this group may involve
flexible scheduling, commute assistance, development pathways, proactive summer planning, and positive attendance
incentives to reduce unpredictability and improve overall well-being.

+ The employees committing the absences having by far the highest, average commute cost per Km at 22 BRL/Km, 
when other clusters are generally below 10 BRL/Km, although only the second highest average transportation expense.
+ The second highest rate of unjustified absences (9%).
+ The second highest rate of absences due to acute diseases (33%), compared to around 20% for most other clusters.
+ An average distribution of absences throughout the week and the year, when compared to other clusters.
+ Overall, the employees doing these absences have one of the lowest presences of risk behaviors, just 29%.
+ The second highest rate of higher education at 67%, much higher than all clusters except one.
+ The average length of absences for this cluster is close to 6 hours, meaning almost a full working day.
+ The highest rate of absences which are considered disciplinary failures (13%), although there are other clusters with only slightly lower rates.

Regarding the “Costly Commutes” cluster, workers face extremely high commuting costs and elevated unjustified or
acute-illness absences, despite low presence of risk behaviors and high education levels. Addressing their needs
could include targeted transportation aid, clear attendance reinforcement, preventive health initiatives, and
individualized follow-up to boost predictability and well-being.

+ By far the highest average absence length, at ~26 hours, which is over 3 working days. Second highest is under 1 working day.
+ The highest rate, by far, of both acute (52%) and chronic disease (32%) related absences, accounting for most absences in this cluster, which can somewhat explain the extreme length of these absences.
+ One of the highest average ages for the employees performing the absence.
+ Being the only cluster without absences in August, other than that the yearly distribution is mostly normal.
+ The distribution of the absences throughout the week is not out of the ordinary.
+ A moderately high commute cost per Km at 10.60 BRL/Km, being one of only 3 clusters above 10, when most clusters are around 6 to 7.
+ A low rate of higher education, just 7%.

With the “Long Absences” cluster, the defining feature is prolonged, medically driven absences linked to high
rates of acute and chronic illness among an older workforce. Offering stronger occupational health programs,
chronic condition management, ergonomic evaluations, and structured return to work processes can help reduce
extended absence durations.

+ The highest rate of near weekend absences by a decent margin at 70%, with all other cluster below 50%.
+ Consequently, the lowest rate of mid-week absences.
+ A relatively expected yearly distribution of absences.
+ An even (in the general context) distribution of absence justifications.
+ Absences being over 5 hours on average, which exceeds half of a working day.
+ A 100% rate of risk behaviors, which is not unique to this cluster.
+ A low rate of higher educated employees, only 10%, it is however worth mentioning that some other clusters have even lower rates.
+ The second lowest average BMI of employees at 23.7, one of only 3 clusters that falls into the ""Healthy weight"" class of BMI.

For the “Near Weekend Absences” cluster, employees consistently take time off around weekends, tend to have
longer absence durations, display universal risk behaviors, and generally have lower education levels. Improving
consistency can be achieved by reinforcing attendance policies, using targeted behavioral interventions, clearly
communicating expectations, and offering development-related support.

+ The employees doing these absences have no children or pets at all (average of 0 for both variables).
+ The highest average body mass index at 31, which already classifies as class 1 obesity, it is the only group to reach this level, all others are below 30.
+ The highest rate of medical care related absences at 74%, where the second highest is below 60% and in general values tend to be arounv 40-50%.
+ A disproportionate peak of absence in February, with almost a quarter (23%) of absences occurring in that month.
+ Overall low summer absence rate (18%), but high winter absence rate (43%).
+ An expected distribution of absences throughout the week.
+ None of these absences being done by employees with higher education, 0% rate of higher education.

In the “No children or pets, high BMI” group, absences are largely linked to health issues,
given that this group has the highest BMI levels and sharp seasonal increases, particularly
in February, among employees without higher education. Strengthening workplace health initiatives,
emphasizing prevention, and providing personalized wellness guidance can help address these challenges.

Interestingly there are clusters with higher maximum ages, but lower averages.
+ The third highest transportation expense on average, with a moderate cost per Km. Both are slightly above the general values.
+ None of the absences in this cluster were done by employees with higher education.
+ The large majority of absences are midweek, 73% which is the highest among all cluster and the only cluster above 70%.
+ The distribution of absences for this cluster across the year is quite uniform, with slighly lower values in winter months.
+ The distribution of absence justifications for this cluster is relatively normal, within the general expectation.
+ The average length of absences for this cluster is roughly half of a working day which is around the expected value, looking at the general values.
+ The highest rate of unjustified absences at 12%, being the only cluster above 10%.

Among the “Oldest Employees” cluster, workers show elevated unjustified absences, face high transportation
costs, and lack higher education, with most absences occurring midweek and lasting typical durations.
Reinforcing attendance expectations, offering tailored support for older employees, and providing
transportation or ergonomic accommodations can improve reliability."
