# 📈 Exploratory Analysis

st.subheader("Page 1: Exploratory Analysis")
st.markdown("""
This section focuses on understanding the raw data and main demographic
trends in employee absence.
Here you can:
* **Filter** the data by demographic factors (e.g., Age, BMI, Education).
* Visualize **univariate distributions** (histograms and boxplots for numerical
            variables and bar charts for categorical variables).
* Explore **bivariate relationships** (scatter plots) between variables like
**Age vs. Absenteeism Hours** for example.
* Identify **raw patterns** before any modeling or clustering is applied.

# ⭐ Cluster Analysis

st.subheader("Page 2: Cluster Analysis")
st.markdown("""
This section dives into segmentation, revealing natural groupings
(clusters) of absences based on their characteristics and the characteristics
of the employees performing the absence.
This is crucial for targeted interventions. Here you can:
* Review **detailed profiles** for each cluster, including a description and
mean values (centroids).
* Use the **Radar Chart** to visually compare cluster profiles across key
features.
* Filter the view to focus only on clusters of interest.
