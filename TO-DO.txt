Pre-processing:
    - EDA
        - EDA:
            - Text for .info, .describe etc.
            - Plots and explanations
        DONE - Datatypes
        DONE -  Feature distributions
        DONE -  Identify Feature incosistencies
            DONE - 'Y' instead of 'Yes'
            DONE -  Numerical variables aren't assigned numerical datatypes ('Service Time', 'Weight')
                DONE - They have '-' as a value, to indicate missing Datatypes
            DONE - Column 'Days since previous absence' has only 0s
            DONE (in outliers) - 'Years until retirement' has a minimum value of -1
                - Add a line acknowledging the issue
        DONE - Outliers
            DONE -  Correct and explain
        DONE Missing Values
            DONE -  Correct and explain
            DONE Explain KNNImputer
            DONE Round imputed Values where required
        DONE - Feature Transformations
            DONE - Create new features
        DONE -  Feature Selection
            DONE - Check Correlations and remove features if needed

Clustering:
    DONE Discplinary failure cluster?
    DONE Modeling:
        - KMeans
        - Hierarchical
        - SOM
        - DBSCAN  

Knowledge in Action:
    DONE Streamlit Dashboard:
        DONE - For EDA
        DONE - For cluster analysis
