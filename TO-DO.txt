Pre-processing:
    - EDA
        - Datatypes
        - Feature distributions
        - Identify Feature incosistencies
            - 'Y' instead of 'Yes'
            - Numerical variables aren't assigned numerical datatypes ('Service Time', 'Weight')
                - They have '-' as a value, to indicate missing Datatypes
            - Column 'Days since previous absence' has only 0s
            - 'Years until retirement' has a minimum value of -1
    - Outliers
        - Correct and explain
    - Missing Values
        - Correct and explain
    - Feature Transformations
        - Create new features
    - Feature Selection
        - Check Correlations and remove features if needed

Clustering:
    - Modeling:
        - KMeans
        -
